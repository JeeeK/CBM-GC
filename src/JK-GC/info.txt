Super Garbage Collection - HypraAss Source
==========================================
1985-2016 J. E. Klasek j klasek.at


The Super GC Version 2.0 2013-11-24. Vastly optimized, but with two
severe bugs:

1. String Descriptor Stack (SDS) bug:
   The GC might hang in while processing the SDS in the case the SDS
   contains a non-empty string!

2. The reserved buffer space of 256 bytes is missing. This was a bug
   from SuperGC V1.1 in HypraAss version 1.1, which has been already
   fixed, but was reintroduced because the fix wasn't commented.


ACME source version, with german comments.
Based on HypraAss' version from 1985-12-27


Prerequisites
-------------

acme			ACME cross-assembler executable 
			at least in version 0.96.4 with report option -r


Files
-----

Makefile		assemble the program
info.txt		this file
jk-gc.asm		assembler source for ACME
jk-gc.l			list output of ACME assembler run
jk-gc.o			code (binary)
jk-gc.r			report output of ACME assembler run



Original version
----------------


derived from the 1985 HypraAss source:

../../../tools/hacat -n ../hypraass/s-gc-8-dok.prg



Assembling with ACME
--------------------

2011-02-28 JK

Source with ACME assembler-syntax: jk-gc.asm 

Typical adapations:

 * "ASL A"  -> "ASL"
 * .BYTE -> !byte
 * !to "jk-gc.o", cbm
   ; set output file and format (has to placed right after the
   ; setup of the program counter)
